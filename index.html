          Tajrish Square, known as Sar-e Pol-e Tajrish, 
          is one of the famous and important areas in the north of Tehran. 
          I often visit Tajrish for shopping, walking, 
          and most of the time, to enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of the area.
           No matter what time of day you go there, you can feel the liveliness
            of the square and its surroundings. Initially,
             I started this project as something easy 
            to access and lively, but after spending time going back and forth, 
          I began to perceive things differently.
