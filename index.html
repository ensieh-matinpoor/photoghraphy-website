          Tajrish Square, known as Sar-e Pol-e Tajrish, 
          is one of the famous and important areas in the north of Tehran. 
          I often visit Tajrish for shopping, walking, 
          and most of the time, to enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of the area.
          No matter what time of day you go there, you can feel the liveliness
          of the square and its surroundings.

          Enghelab Street is located in the heart of the capital, Tehran, Iran.
           This street stretches along the east-west axis and spans approximately 5 kilometers, 
           making it one of the longest streets in the city. In fact, Enghelab Street is about one-third the length of Valiasr Street.
          The primary reason for constructing this street was to 
          create an access route to the University of Tehran, which is considered one of the first and most prestigious universities in Iran.

          Birmingham, a city located in the center of England,
           is known for its diverse mix of nationalities, cultures, colors, religions, and even clothing styles.
            As a newcomer to the city, I found my camera to be a valuable tool for exploring 
            the area and getting to know my fellow citizens. 
            Through photography, I attempted to capture the variety and diversity 
            of people living together in the city center,...

          Fly tipping is one of the major problems in some ares. 
          Many people, especially in the biger city and in some lower areas,
          throw out their unwanted items outside their homes, on the streets,
          or sometimes in fields and roads. 
          The amount of stuff that people throw out often overwhelms me.

          Everything shut down; we should stay at home. The new virus spreads quickly.
           Everyone is getting bored as they can't come outside,
            and all activities have come to a standstill. My window became a good place to spend time and have fun. 
            During the pandemic,I brought my camera and started shooting photos from my window.

          This project was formed during the time of pandemic and quarantine.
           Those days, standing by the window and looking outside at the sky was 
           one of the fascinating pastimes for me. The changing colors of the sky and the swift 
           movement of clouds captivated me. I started taking photos of the sky.

          In the heart of the city, where concrete jungles dominate the landscape, 
          an all-too-familiar sight unfolds daily a forsaken mattress abandoned on the street. 
          Each mattress carries its unique tale, a silent testimony to the transient nature of human existence.
